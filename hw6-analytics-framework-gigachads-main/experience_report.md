Initially, I (Jeremy) had a bit of trouble getting the API keys to work because Google Cloud would 
not accept my credit card info. I emailed Yifan as requested in the README, and he told me that I should register 
for a Google Cloud account with a non-CMU email address. He also encouraged me to use GitHub issues for any further questions. 
I came across another issue with ECharts not being able to display the x-axis label names, so I opened an issue and I got a very 
quick response (within a minute). He recommended me 3 solution approaches and all were very helpful. I ended up going with this 
3rd solution approach. The technical support I received from this team was perfect: quick response time and helpful solutions.
Team wzc's readme was very straightforward and their framework was also very easy to use so no other technical support 
was needed while completing milestone C. Nathan and Tim also did not need any technical support while completing their parts of milestone C.
